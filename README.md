## 🚀 Projects I'm Proud Of  

### 🔹 [Hixbi](https://hixbi.com/)  
**Tech:** React, Next.js, Cloudflare Workers, Stripe, Zustand, NextAuth

**Highlights:**  
- Deployed globally with **Cloudflare Workers** for microservice-based low-latency responses — even faster than OpenAI.  
- Integrated **Stripe** for secure payments and tiered token-based monetization.  
- Built a scalable frontend with React, Next.js, and Zustand (improving UI performance by 200%).  
- Added NextAuth authentication with role-based access control.  
- Designed REST APIs for multiple LLMs ensuring reliability and speed.
